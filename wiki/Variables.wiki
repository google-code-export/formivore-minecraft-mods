=Variables=
Variables control the size, shape, frequency, material, and many other aspects of structures. In particular buildings like the default procedurally generated towers do not have any layers associated with them and are instead totally determined by variable settings. 
Variables have a simple format, with one line per variable:
\<variable name\>=\<value\>
The order variables appear in the template file does not matter.
==Standard Variables==
These variables should be provided for all template files used by the Great Wall Mod and the Walled City Mod.
weight=<weight>
The likelihood weight of template during random generation. Weight is relative to the sum of weights provided for other templates that perform the same role. For example if there are two wall templates for city walls, a sandstone template (weight=2) and a cobblestone template (weight=3) the chance of generating sandstone city walls will be 40%.
A separate calculation is done for the templates provided for city streets, street buildings, etc.
Defaults to 1.

embed_into_distance=<depth>
Specifies how many z-levels of the template will be below ground. Note that for buildings constructed alongside walls, "ground level" is actually specified by the walk_height variable of the wall. Use this to construct basements, foundations, and anything below walking level.

dimensions=<height>,<width>,<length>
The dimensions of the template you are providing. Height is the number of layers provided. Width is the North-South width. Length is the East-West width. For reference, north is the top of the text file. Note that wall template dimensions will have a different interpretation, but you should still give dimension values in the same order as the standard layout(i.e. the first value=number of layers).  See LAYERS below for more details.

max_leveling=<leveling>
Specifies the maximum depth below the source block that will be filled in order to level the site.  If there is more air directly below the maximum depth, the template will not be built. If a base layer is provided this will be used for leveling, otherwise local blocks will be used. Any leveling will take place before the site is built, preserving basement space.
Defaults to 4.

max_cut_in =<cut_in>
Specifies the maximum height above the source block that will be set to air in order to clear the site.
Defaults to 0.

***NOTE: The following variables from the ruins mod are currently NOT supported and will be ignored:
unique, acceptable_target_block, allowable_overhang, leveling_buffer ,cut_in_buffer, preserve_water, preserve_lava, preserve_plants.


==Wall Template Variables==
A number of additional variables are required from template files that describe walls.
biomes=<biome1>,<biome2>,<biome3>,...
A comma-separated list of the biomes that can spawn this wall or city type. Should only be used for top-level templates (not child templates). Instead of a list, you may have biomes=ALL to allow spawning in all biomes. Listing the Underground biome for city templates indicates that this city type will only spawn underground. Allowable biomes are: Rainforest, Swampland, Seasonal Forest, Forest, Savanna, Shrubland, Taiga, Desert, Plains, Ice Desert, Tundra, Hell, Sky, Hills, Ocean, Underground
Defaults to ALL.

building_templates=<filename1>,<filename2>,<filename3>,...
A comma-separated list of template file names that will be used to construct buildings alongside this wall. Instead of a list, you may have either building_templates=ALL or building_templates=NONE which will load all or none of the templates in the building folder as potential child templates. These files should be placed in the building subfolder.
Defaults to ALL.

street_templates=<filename1>,<filename2>,<filename3>,...
Only for city wall templates used in the Walled City mod. A comma-separated list of template file names that will be used to generate streets inside the current template. Instead of a list you may have street_templates=ALL or street_templates=NONE which will load all or none of the templates in the streets folder as potential child templates. These files should be placed in the streets subfolder.
Defaults to ALL.

street_density=<density>
Only for city wall templates used in the Walled City mod. Should be an integer between 0 and 20.
Defaults to 6.

merge_walls=<1/0>
Only for the Great Wall Mod. If set to 1 will allow walls to merge and cross over each other. Useful to create infinite cities.
Defaults to 0.

level_interior=<1/0>
Only for city wall templates used in the Walled City mod. If set to 1 the city interior will be leveled to remove water and excessive high and low points.
Defaults to 1.

walk_height=<height>
For walls that serve as a roadway, the height of the roadway (relative to the bottom of the template). This value is used for a)positioning elements such as towers to allow transit b)ensuring this level is always above water.
Defaults to 0.

min_length=<length>
max_length=<length>
The minimum and maximum allowed lengths of the wall.
Defaults to 150/1000.

building_interval=<buildling_interval>
The minimum separation required between buildings built alongside this wall.
Defaults to 75.

make_buildings=<1/0>
If set to 1 make buildings along side this wall, if set to 0 don't.
Defaults to 1.

make_end_towers=<1/0>
If set to 1 make towers at the wall endpoints, if set to 0 don't.
Defaults to 1.


==Default Tower Variables==
These variables control the style of the default resizable towers. These variables should also be provided in each wall template file.
tower_rule=<ruleID>
The rule number of the primary blocks used to construct towers. 
Defaults to none (uses tower_block).

default_tower_weight=<weight>
The weight of towers. Both default towers and buildings from template listed in the building_templates variable can be generated alongside walls. This weight specifies how likely default tower are relative to template buildings.
Default to 1.

tower_offset=<offset>
The x offset (distance from centerline) of side towers from the wall edges. Negative values will create towers closer to the center.
Defaults to 0.

mob_probability=<probability>
Probability that a tower will contain zombie, skeleton, or creeper spawners. Also gives a chance to spawn chests.
Default to 0.2.

zombie_pigmen_probability=<probability>
enderman_probability=<probability>
cave_spider probability=<probability>
Probability that the tower will contain a spawner of the given type.
Default to 0.0.

chest_probability=<probability>
Additional probability that the tower will contain chests.
Default to 0.0.

populate_furniture=<1/0>
If set to one mod will generate some furniture inside of towers.
Defautls to 0.

circular_probability=<probability>
Probabily that a tower will have a circular cross section. Otherwise it will be square.
Default to 0.3.

square_min_height=<height>
square_max_height=<height>
square_min_width=<width>
square_max_width=<width>
circular_min_height=<height>
circular_max_height=<height>
circular_min_width=<width>
circular_max_width=<width>
The range of heights and widths allowed for square and circular towers respectively. Actual dimensions will be chosen randomly from these ranges.
Default to 11/15/7/7/11/16/7/7

square_roof_styles=<style1>,<style2>,... 
circular_tower_roof_styles=<style1>,<style2>,...
Lists of allowed roof style for towers. Styles may be repeated to increase their weight. 
Allowable roof styles are: Crenel, Steep, Steep Trim, Shallow, Dome, Cone, Two Sided
Defaults to: Crenel

square_roof_rule=<ruleID>
circular_tower_roof_rule=<ruleID>
The rule number used to generate roofs for towers.
If no rule is provided a default choice is made based on tower_block.
